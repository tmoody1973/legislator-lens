# üéâ Hybrid AI Integration Complete!

## Google Chrome AI Challenge 2025 - Ready for Testing

**Status**: Hybrid AI implementation complete, ready for testing ‚úÖ
**Date**: October 5, 2025

---

## üìä What's Been Built

### API Endpoints (Server-Side) ‚úÖ

1. **`/api/bills/analyze`** - Main hybrid analysis endpoint
   - **Quick Analysis**: Chrome AI only (fast, private, offline)
   - **Standard Analysis**: Chrome AI + selective Cloud AI
   - **Deep Analysis**: Chrome AI + full Cloud AI (historical + news)
   - Automatic caching in Supabase
   - Performance tracking (separate Chrome/Cloud timing)
   - Smart routing based on availability

2. **`/api/bills/historical`** - Historical bill analysis
   - Uses Google Gemini API
   - Finds similar bills from past 10-15 years
   - Compares outcomes and trends
   - Generates recommendations
   - Cached results in database

3. **`/api/bills/news`** - News correlation
   - Uses Guardian API (you have this!) + NewsAPI (optional)
   - Finds related news articles
   - Creates timeline of events
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Multi-source deduplication

### Database Tables ‚úÖ

Created in Supabase (migration `002_add_hybrid_ai_tables.sql`):

- `bill_analyses` - Comprehensive hybrid analyses with timing metrics
- `bill_historical_analyses` - Gemini historical comparisons
- `bill_news_correlations` - News article correlations
- All with proper indexing, RLS policies, and caching

### Test Page ‚úÖ

**`/test/hybrid-ai`** - Interactive testing interface
- Check AI availability (Chrome + Cloud)
- Test Quick/Standard/Deep analysis modes
- View performance metrics (Chrome vs Cloud timing)
- See which providers were used
- Tabbed results: Summary, Categories, Provisions, Historical, News
- Real-time error handling and loading states

## üöÄ How to Test

### 1. Start the Dev Server (Already Running)

The server is already running at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Navigate to Test Page

Open: `http://localhost:3000/test/hybrid-ai`

### 3. Check Availability

Click "Check Availability" to see which AI providers are ready:
- **Chrome AI**: Requires Chrome Canary + Early Preview (still waiting for enrollment)
- **Gemini**: ‚úÖ Configured (API key added)
- **Guardian**: ‚úÖ Configured (you have this!)
- **NewsAPI**: Configure if desired (optional)

### 4. Run Analysis

Try each analysis level:

**Quick Analysis** (Chrome AI only):
- Summary (Summarizer API)
- Categories (Prompt API)
- Provisions (Prompt API)
- 100% private, no cloud calls
- Should complete in 2-5 seconds

**Standard Analysis** (Balanced):
- Everything in Quick
- + Stakeholder perspectives (Prompt API)
- Minimal cloud usage
- Should complete in 3-7 seconds

**Deep Analysis** (Full power):
- Everything in Standard
- + Historical bill comparison (Gemini)
- + Related news articles (Guardian)
- + Timeline and sentiment analysis
- Should complete in 5-12 seconds

## üéØ What Happens When You Test

### Scenario 1: Chrome AI Not Available Yet

**Current State**: You're waiting for Early Preview enrollment

**What you'll see**:
- Availability check shows Chrome AI unavailable
- Analysis attempts will fail with helpful error messages
- Cloud AI features (Gemini, Guardian) should work if tested separately

**Workaround**: Can test Cloud AI features by:
1. Calling `/api/bills/historical` directly (Gemini)
2. Calling `/api/bills/news` directly (Guardian)

### Scenario 2: Chrome AI Becomes Available

**Once enrolled**: Chrome AI enrollment confirmed, `window.ai` available

**What you'll see**:
- Availability check shows all Chrome APIs green ‚úÖ
- Quick Analysis completes successfully in 2-5s
- Standard Analysis works with Chrome + minimal cloud
- Deep Analysis shows full hybrid power

**Performance Example**:
```json
{
  "processingTime": {
    "chrome": 2100,  // 2.1 seconds for Chrome AI
    "cloud": 3500,   // 3.5 seconds for Gemini + Guardian
    "total": 5600    // 5.6 seconds total
  },
  "providers": {
    "chrome": true,
    "gemini": true,
    "news": true
  }
}
```

## üîß Testing Cloud AI Now (Before Chrome AI)

You can test the cloud features immediately:

### Test Gemini Historical Analysis

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bills/historical \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "billId": "hr-1234-118",
    "billTitle": "Affordable Housing Access Act",
    "billSummary": "A bill to establish grants for affordable housing",
    "provisions": [
      "Establish affordable housing development grants",
      "Expand rental assistance programs",
      "Provide first-time homebuyer assistance"
    ]
  }'
```

### Test Guardian News Correlation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bills/news \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "billId": "hr-1234-118",
    "billTitle": "Affordable Housing Access Act",
    "billSummary": "A bill to establish grants for affordable housing",
    "keywords": ["housing", "affordable housing", "rental assistance"],
    "billIntroducedDate": "2024-03-15"
  }'
```
