# 🧪 Hybrid AI Test Results

**Test Date**: October 5, 2025
**Status**: Partial Success ✅

---

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Guardian API (News Correlation) - **WORKING PERFECTLY**

**Test Command**: `node scripts/test-hybrid-ai.js`

**Results:**
- ✅ Successfully fetched **20 related news articles** about affordable housing
- ✅ **Timeline generation** working - Articles grouped by week
- ✅ **Sentiment analysis** working - Detected "negative" sentiment
- ✅ **Database caching** working - Second request returned `"fromCache": true`
- ✅ **Processing time**: ~1200ms for first request
- ✅ **Article metadata** complete: titles, URLs, authors, images, dates

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "US whistleblowers say they were fired for raising fair housing concerns",
      "source": "The Guardian",
      "publishedAt": "2025-09-29T20:12:41.000Z",
      "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/..."
    }
    // ... 19 more articles
  ],
  "totalResults": 20,
  "sentiment": "negative",
  "timelineEvents": [ /* 10 weeks of grouped articles */ ],
  "fromCache": false,
  "processingTime": 1196
}
```

### 2. API Endpoints - **WORKING**

All three hybrid AI endpoints are live and responding:

| Endpoint | Status | Method |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `/api/bills/analyze` | ✅ Live | GET, POST |
| `/api/bills/historical` | ✅ Live | GET, POST |
| `/api/bills/news` | ✅ Live | GET, POST |

### 3. Middleware - **CONFIGURED**

Public routes configured correctly:
- `/api/bills/analyze(.*)`
- `/api/bills/historical(.*)`
- `/api/bills/news(.*)`
- `/test(.*)` pages

### 4. Database - **WORKING**

Supabase caching confirmed:
- `bill_news_correlations` table storing responses ✅
- Cache retrieval working (`fromCache: true`) ✅
- Timestamps being recorded ✅

## ✅ FULLY WORKING - ALL SYSTEMS GO!

### Gemini API (Historical Analysis) - **WORKING PERFECTLY** ✅

**Current Status**: ✅ Working - Returns structured historical bill analysis

**Solution Applied:**
- Changed model from `gemini-pro` to `gemini-2.0-flash` in `lib/cloud-ai/gemini.ts`
- Improved JSON parsing with markdown code block removal
- Lowered temperature to 0.3 for more structured responses
- Added comprehensive error logging

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Successfully analyzed historical bills
- ✅ Returned 4 similar bills with proper congress numbers (117, 110, 116, 114)
- ✅ Complete historical context and recommendations
- ✅ **Database caching working** - Second request returns `"fromCache": true`
- ✅ **Processing time**: ~6400ms for first request, <100ms cached
- ✅ All JSON fields properly structured (no more "Various" errors)
